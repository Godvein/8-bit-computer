A **clock in computing** is a fundamental component used to synchronize and coordinate the operations of a computer system. It generates a series of regular, timed electrical pulses that drive the execution of instructions, data transfer, and overall system operation.  

This repository provides an overview of a clockâ€™s function, implementation, and significance in a computer system, along with a basic implementation of a digital clock circuit in Logisim.

## What is a Clock in Computing?  

A clock in computing serves as the heartbeat of the system. It ensures all components, such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals, operate in harmony.  

- **Clock Signal**: A periodic square wave that oscillates between high and low states.  
- **Clock Frequency**: Determines the speed at which a computer processes instructions (measured in Hertz, e.g., GHz).  
- **Synchronization**: The clock signal ensures that all system components operate in lockstep.

## How Does a Clock Work?  

1. **Clock Generation**:  
   The clock signal is typically generated by a **crystal oscillator**, which produces a stable and precise frequency.  

2. **Distribution**:  
   The signal is distributed across the system using a **clock distribution network**, ensuring minimal delay and interference.  

3. **Clock Cycles**:  
   Each clock cycle represents one full period of the signal, during which operations like fetching, decoding, and executing instructions are performed.

## Why is the Clock Important?  

- **Timing and Synchronization**: Maintains proper coordination between components.  
- **Performance**: Higher clock frequencies enable faster instruction execution.  
- **Stability**: A reliable clock ensures predictable system behavior.

## Clock in Digital Circuits  

In digital circuit design, the clock signal controls sequential circuits like flip-flops, counters, and state machines. These circuits change their states only on clock edges (rising or falling).  

- **Rising Edge**: When the signal transitions from low to high.  
- **Falling Edge**: When the signal transitions from high to low.
